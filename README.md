How to use
1. Extract this program to a folder
2. BACKUP THE FOLLOWING BEFORE CONTINUING ".\Resident Evil 5\nativePC_MT\Image\Archive" AS THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT CREATE A BACKUP OR A WAY TO UNRANDOMIZE LOCATIONS. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED.
3. Provide the arc files from ".\Resident Evil 5\nativePC_MT\Image\Archive" and place them in a folder named "Archive" that is next to the randomizer program (same folder as "ap_arc.py")
4. In input.json, the first data piece is the location as per the game's location data, 2nd is the itemID that you are placing there.
5. Open powershell targetting the randomizer folder and type "py ap_arc.py"
6. When the program finishes running, take the arc files and return them to the Resident Evil 5 folder you originally got them
